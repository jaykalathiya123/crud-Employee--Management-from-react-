# Employee Management System (CRUD)

## Project Overview
The Employee Management System is a web application that allows users to manage employee details. It includes features like creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee information. This system is built using **React** for the frontend and **localStorage** to store the employee data locally, ensuring persistence even after a page refresh.

## Project Objectives
- Implement a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for managing employee data.
- Use React's state management to handle and display employee information.
- Store data using localStorage to ensure persistence across sessions.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with employee records.

## Features
1. **Add Employee**: A form for adding new employee details, such as name, age, department, and position.
2. **View Employee List**: Displays a list of all employees stored in localStorage.
3. **Update Employee**: Edit employee details using an update form.
4. **Delete Employee**: Remove an employee from the list.
5. **Persist Data**: Employee data is stored in the browserâ€™s localStorage, allowing it to remain even after a page refresh.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **State Management**: React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks
- **Data Storage**: localStorage (in-browser storage)
