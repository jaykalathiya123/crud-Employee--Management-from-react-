# Employee Management System (CRUD)

## Project Overview
The Employee Management System is a web application that allows users to manage employee details. It includes features like creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) employee information. This system uses *React* for the frontend and *localStorage* to store the employee data locally.

## Project Objectives
- Implement a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system.
- Manage employee data using React's state management.
- Use localStorage to persist data even after refreshing the page.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for managing employee details.

## Features
- *Add Employee*: A form to add new employee details like name, age, department, and position.
- *View Employee List*: Displays a list of all employees stored in localStorage.
- *Update Employee*: Allows users to edit employee details using an update form.
- *Delete Employee*: Removes an employee from the list.
- *Persist Data*: Employee data is stored in localStorage, ensuring it remains even after a page refresh.

## Technology Stack
- *Frontend*: React.js
- *State Management*: React's useState and useEffect hooks
- *Data Storage*: localStorage (in-browser storage)
